# INAV Configurator dev builds

This repo hosts releases with pre-release INAV Configurator files.

For issues, use the iNavFlight/inav-configurator repository.

# MacOS builds

MacOS builds are not signed, so you will need to run ```xcattr -cr /path/to/your/INAV Configurator.app``` from the command line to remove the warnings about it being a downloaded application or moving it to trash when trying to launch.
