# INAV Configurator dev builds

This repository hosts pre-release builds of INAV Configurator.

For issues, use the iNavFlight/inav-configurator repository.

# MacOS builds

MacOS builds are not signed, so you will need to run ```xattr -cr /path/to/your/INAV Configurator.app``` from the command line to remove the warnings about it being a downloaded application or moving it to trash when trying to launch.
